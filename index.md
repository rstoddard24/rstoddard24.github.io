## Summary
## 
I am a researcher with expertise at the intersection of chemical
engineering and data science, interested in understanding and addressing
complex global challenges. Currently I am pursuing my PhD in chemical
engineering at University of Washington, where I am focusing on
solution-processed, thin film semiconductors for photovoltaics.
Previously I worked as a
Research Scienctist / Engineer at Argonne National Lab, SINTEF Energy
Research (Norway), and Bosch (Germany)
